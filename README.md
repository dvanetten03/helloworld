Hello all.

I am an avid programmer with a varied background in the mortgage industry, operations, marketing and human resources.  I like to write scripts in Ruby or RoR, but I am well-versed in mySQL, html, CSS and javascript.  I am currently working on node.js and would like to learn some python in the future.
